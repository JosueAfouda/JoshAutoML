**This web app is a No-Code tool for Exploratory Data Analysis and building Machine Learning model for Regression and Classification tasks.**

I used PyCaret and Streamlit.

1. Load your dataset file (CSV file);

2. Click on *Profile Dataset* button in order to generate the pandas profiling of the dataset;

3. Choose your target column;

4. Choose the machine learning task (Regression or Classification);

5. Click on *Run Modelling* in order to start the training process.

When the model is built, you can view the results like the pipeline model, Residuals plot, ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, Feature importance, etc.

6. Download the Pipeline model in your local computer.
